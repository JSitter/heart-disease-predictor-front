# Heart Disease Predictor

This website seeks to promote heart health through the use of informative displays and a heart health screening feature. The screening feature is done using a machine learning model that is trained on the UCI Heart Disease Dataset hosted on Kaggle. 

The evaluated model achieves close to 90% accuracy with a low occurance of false negatives. 
This is important because when making a prediction for disease it's generally more acceptable to err on the side of false positives than false negatives.

## Front End Technologies
The front end uses React and D3 to visualize heart disease data and show how a user's scores compare with the scores in the dataset. 

## Back End Technologies
The backend uses flask for routing and running the trained machine learning model.
